### Inside Unit Testing:&nbsp; Principles & Practices
Product quality, code quality, and time to market can all be improved and optimized through effective use of unit tests. Testing in small, isolated, and deterministic units fosters code characteristics such as testability, adaptability, and reliability. This testing strategy shifts failures towards the left of our SDLC and greatly reduces development time, costs, and risks.

This course teaches the principles and practices of unit testing, along with core techniques for writing testable software and avoiding test smells. Test doubles are also taught as effective methods for isolating dependencies, further enhancing testability. An introduction to test-driven development (TDD) is used to integrate unit testing practices with those of TDD.
